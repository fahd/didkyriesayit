I wanted to make a simple viral application. I used NBA Superstar Kyrie Irving (who says many questionable things), and gamified his quotes.

[I originally uploaded this here on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c8p4d9/oc_did_kyrie_say_it_a_simple_quiz_to_see_if_you/)
to which it reached #2 on the /r/nba subreddit.
